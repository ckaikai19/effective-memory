              The Catcher in the Rye is an American novel by J. D. Salinger that
              was partially published in serial form from 1945â€“46 before being
              novelized in 1951. Originally intended for adults, it is often
              read by adolescents for its themes of angst and alienation, and as
              a critique of superficiality in society.[4][5] The novel also
              deals with complex issues of innocence, identity, belonging, loss,
              connection, sex, and depression. The main character, Holden
              Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion.[6] Caulfield,
              nearly of age, gives his opinion on just about everything as he
              narrates his recent life events. The Catcher has been translated
              widely.[7] About one million copies are sold each year, with total
              sales of more than 65 million books.[8] The novel was included on
              Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written
              since 1923,[9] and it was named by Modern Library and its readers
              as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th
              century.[10][11][12] In 2003, it was listed at number 15 on the
              BBC's survey "The Big Read".
